# ðŸš€ Improved Parallel Algorithm for Finding Minimum Cuts in Stochastic Flow Networks

This repository provides all the necessary code and resources to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript: "Efficient Minimum Cut Detection in Stochastic Networks."

The research introduces the Dynamic Parallel Graph Cutting Algorithm (DPGCA) and includes comparative analyses against traditional minimum cut algorithms.

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Usage

### 1. Download the Project Files
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

**Using Git:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluetuka/Merging-Method-Review.git
cd Merging-Method-Review
```

Or click Download ZIP, extract it, then open the extracted folder.

### 2. Install Python & Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas psutil
```

### 3. Run the Main Script

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the project and generate outputs (plots, logs, etc.) in the console or in designated output files.

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

- **Python version: Confirm youâ€™re using Python 3.x:**

```bash
python --version
```

- **Running in virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
